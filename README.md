2. From the game files, copy `music_order.bin`, `musicinfo.bin`, `wordlist.bin`, `don_cos_reward.bin`, `shougou.bin`,`neiro.bin` to `wwwroot/data/datatable` folder.

3. (Optional) In `Certificates` folder, import `root.pfx` to trusted root store, `cert.pfx` to personal store. All the other import options can be kept default.

4. Visit http://localhost:5000 if the web ui starts without errors, the config is fine.
